Capstone Final Project for Galvanize - MapMe

I am currently working to complete

my final project is a hiking/walking/running app to be used on a mobile device.  The main reason I wanted to create this app is for safety.  I wanted an app to follow me when I hike that would give my longitude/latitutde coordinates, in real time.  I thought this could be a life saver, in the event that I lost my way or was injured and needed to be able to tell someone exactly where i was.  

I used the Google Maps API to creating your route/path as you walk/run. Along with the map of your location and and route you are creating, speed, altitude and your latitude/longitude coordinates, are also displayed.  

TECHNOLOGIES USED
Ionic v1
Javascript 
Angular Js
Node
jQuery
HTML 
CSS

Galvanize requires that we use a framework or language weâ€™ve never used before.  I chose Ionic v1 since my app is to be used on a mobile device.  I also used Apache Cordova, since I need access to the native features of the mobile device.  (gps, camera and data connectivity)

This app is incomplete.  I am working to get the distance included in the data and I would also like the users to be able to set up an account so they can save their routes along with the details.  

Features to be added  in the future:

1. Calculating steps 
2. Calorie count
3. An alert to be available so they user is alerted on how much water they should drink based on the temperature and difficulty of the hike/run/walk.
